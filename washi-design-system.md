i want to create a new design system for WASH Institute, a non-profit that works on Water, Health and Sanitation issues in India

use @design-system.html as a reference for what elements to have in it, but we follow a different color scheme and fonts

we only have a light theme, no dark mode.

ask me questions to get started on implementing my new designs system

i will give you some context beforehand:

1. font: Garamond for headings, Inter for long texts
2. colors: yellow,

present your plan first in this .md doc before implementing

wait for me to answer questions, tweak and review your plan before implementing
